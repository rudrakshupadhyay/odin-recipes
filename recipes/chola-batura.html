        Chole Bhature also known as Chana Bhatura is one of the most popular Punjabi dish liked almost all over
        India. Chole stands for a spiced tangy chickpea curry and Bhatura is a soft and fluffy fried leavened
        bread. Chola Bhatura always make for a delicious and filling meal. In this recipe post, I have 
        included the step-by-step pictorial of making both the chana curry as well as a quick bhatura that 
        is made without yeast.

    <h2>About Chole Bhature</h2>
    <p>
        Chana Bhatura is a spicy, tasty and a filling dish. I have eaten this dish at many places in Punjab 
        and Delhi. Each restaurants or dhaba (eateries on highways) have their own flavors and taste in the 
        chickpea curry.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some places the curry is very spicy, at other places it has tangy taste and the consistency of 
        the curry also varies from slightly thick to semi-dry and dry.
    </p>
    <p>
        This recipe has spicy flavors. This is my mom’s recipe and unlike other versions of chana curry recipes
        posted on the blog, this one has a comforting taste and flavor. It does not taste like the restaurant
        or dhaba versions but taste very good.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even the bhature size and flavor varies from restaurants to restaurants. The bhature ideally should be 
        less oily and should puff fully. They should also be eaten hot and fresh. If you parcel the bhature 
        from a restaurant then you won’t get the real taste as they become limp and chewy.

    <h2>Chola Recipe:-</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            First rinse 1 cup white chickpeas a couple of times in water. Then soak them in enough water 
            overnight or for 7 to 8 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next day they will double in size.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then drain the water.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a 3 litre pressure cooker add the chickpeas. Also add 3 cups water and ¼ teaspoon salt. I have 
            used a pressure cooker but you can also use a pot or pan.The chickpeas will take a lesser time to 
            cook in the pressure cooker than cooking them in a pot.You can also add a pinch or two of baking 
            soda while cooking them. Addition of baking soda is optional.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pressure cook chickpeas for 10 to 12 whistles or for about 15 to 20 minutes or till they are tender
            and cooked well.Once the pressure settles down on its own then open the lid of pressure cooker and
            check if the chickpeas are cooked well or not. It is important to cook them till they are soft and 
            have a melt in the mouth texture.If cooking them in a pan then it can take about an hour or more. 
            Just ensure they are well cooked. Timing to cook chickpeas will depend upon their quality and age.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once done then drain all the water and keep the cooked chickpeas aside.
        </li>

    <h2>Ingredients for Bhatura:-</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sooji (rava or fine semolina)</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon oil or ghee</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon granulated fine sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt or as required</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ cup curd (yogurt)</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons water for kneading or add as needed</li>
        <li>oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bhatura Recipe:-</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Sieve the all-purpose flour (maida), salt, baking soda and baking powder in a mixing bowl. Then add
             the semolina and sugar to the sifted ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now add the curd (yogurt). With a spoon mix the yogurt with the sifted ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adding 2 to 3 tablespoons water in parts and at intervals, first mix well and then start kneading. 
            Knead to a smooth, supple and soft dough.
        </li>
        <li>
             Cover the dough with a wet cotton napkin and keep aside to rest for 30 to 45 minutes or up-to 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Later pinch medium sized balls from the dough. Roll each ball between your palms to a round shape.
            Keep the dough ball on your work surface and flatten lightly with your fingers. Spread a bit of oil
            on both sides of the dough ball.Using a rolling pin, roll into an oval or elongated shape. You can 
            also make a round shape.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a kadai or wok, keep oil for deep frying on medium-high flame. Drop the rolled dough in hot oil 
            and it will start puffing within a minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the sizzling of the oil stops, turn over and fry the other side. You can flip once or twice 
            for even cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
            When light golden or golden, remove the bhatura and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. 
            This way fry the bhatura in batches.
