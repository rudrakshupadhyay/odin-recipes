    <p> 
        Palak Paneer is one of the most popular Indian dish made with succulent Paneer cubes (Indian cottage 
        cheese) in a smooth spinach sauce. I share two ways to make this healthy dish – a homestyle 
        version and a restaurant style version with a charcoal smoking method (brought back on reader’s 
        demand). Both the vibrant green palak paneer recipes are made with fresh spinach leaves (palak in 
        Hindi), aromatics, herbs and spices. Make these super delicious spinach paneer recipes with my easy 
        step-by-step.

    <h2>Homestyle Palak Paneer Recipe:-</h2>
    <p>
        Palak Paneer is one of the most popular Indian curries around, and with good reason. This deliciously 
        creamy and vibrantly green dish is made with paneer in a mildly spiced fresh spinach sauce. This is a 
        delightful and easy to make vegetarian main you just have to try!
    </p>
    <p>
        This delicious palak paneer is a family recipe that my Mom passed down to me. She has been making this 
        recipe for our family for years, and I am so happy to get to share it with you here.

        Palak paneer pairs well with roti, naan, or paratha. If you are gluten-free, you can also serve 
        it with cumin rice or biryani rice, saffron rice or ghee rice.

        <li>Fresh cream or malai – 1 to 2 tablespoons (for richness)</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Step-by-step process of making now:-</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Using a colander or strainer, rinse the palak (spinach) leaves (250 grams or 0.55 pounds), 
            very well under running water.
        </li>
        <li>
             Boil 3 cups water in a pan, microwave or electric heater. Add ¼ teaspoon salt to the hot water and 
             stir. Then add the spinach leaves to the hot water. Let the spinach leaves sit in the water for 
             about 1 minute.If doing this on a stove-top, be sure to remove the pan from the hot burner.While 
             the water is coming to a boil, make a bowl of ice water and set it aside. Just add 8 to 10 ice 
             cubes to 3 cups of water to get cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
            After 1 minute, strain the spinach leaves.
        </li>
        <li>
            Immediately transfer the palak (spinach) leaves to the bowl containing ice cold water. This method 
            of “shocking” the spinach helps preserve the vibrant green color of the spinach.Allow the spinach 
            leaves to stay in the cold water for a minute to stop the cooking process.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain the ice cold water and press the spinach to remove any excess moisture. Add the spinach in a 
            blender or grinder jar with 1 inch chopped ginger, 1 to 2 garlic cloves and 1 to 2 chili peppers 
            (green chillies).You can use a hand-held immersion blender to make the puree if you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a smooth spinach purée by blitzing the ingredients together. There should be no need to add 
            any water to make the purée. Set the spinach purée aside.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">Make Spinach Gravy</h3>
    <ol start="7">
        <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons oil, ghee or butter in a pan or kadai (wok). If using butter, melt it on a low 
            heat making sure that it does not brown.
        </li>
        <li>
             Add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds and let them splutter.
        </li>
        <li>
             Then add one small to medium-sized tej patta (Indian bay leaf).
        </li>
        <li>
            Add ⅓ cup finely chopped onions (1 small to medium sized onion).
        </li>
        <li>
            Sauté until the onions become golden.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic. Sauté till the raw aroma of garlic goes away, but stop 
            short of browning the garlic.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add ⅓ cup chopped tomatoes (1 small or medium sized tomato).
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir and sauté the tomatoes until they soften.
        </li>
        <li>
             Once the tomatoes are softened and you see fat releasing from the sides of the mixture, then add 
             ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ½ teaspoon red chili powder (or substitute cayenne pepper or paprika) 
             and a pinch of asafoetida (hing).You can find asafoetida at your local spice store or on amazon, 
             but if you don’t have it, you can skip it.Also, please note that many commercially available 
             brands of asafoetida are processed with wheat. If you are gluten intolerant, please be sure to 
             purchase gluten free asafoetida.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix very well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the spinach purée to the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add about ½ cup of water or as required. Mix and stir again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Simmer the gravy for 6 to 7 minutes or more until the palak puree is cooked. Season with salt as 
            required. The gravy will have thickened by now.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir and add ¼ to ½ teaspoon garam masala powder.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">Assemble Palak Paneer</h3>
    <ol start="22">
        <li>
            Stir again and then add the paneer cubes (200 to 250 grams cottage cheese) directly to the gravy.
            You can also opt to lightly pan-fry the paneer cubes in some oil until they are lightly browned and 
            then add them to the palak gravy. In this case, you don’t need to cook the paneer further.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix gently and turn off the heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lastly add 2 tablespoons of light cream or cooking cream or low-fat cream. I used Amul brand cream. 
            If using heavy whipping cream, then add 1 tablespoon of it.You can also add 1 teaspoon crushed dry 
            fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) at this step, however this is optional.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir gently so that the cream gets uniformly incorporated into the gravy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve Palak Paneer hot or warm with roti, naan or paratha or cumin rice or ghee rice. You can top 
            it with some butter or cream also while serving.Drizzle a few drops of lime or lemon juice on top 
            along with ginger julienne. Enjoy!
